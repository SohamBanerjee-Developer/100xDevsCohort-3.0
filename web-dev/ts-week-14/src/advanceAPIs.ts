//a file without any top-level import or export declarations is treated as a script 
//whose contents are available in the global scope (and therefore to modules as well).
// but Modules are executed within their own scope, not in the global scope
// If you have a file that doesnâ€™t currently have any imports or exports, but you want 
//to be treated as a module, add the line: export {};
//as ts documentation the syntax is borrowed from js, same syntax work in js
